# SRW-games

The information about the original Windows executables.

To generate an assembler version of the original executable, put the static recompiler (*SRW.exe*) and the original executable in the appropriate subdirectory and run *build-x86.sh* (or *build-llasm.sh*).

[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) (Netwide Assembler) is needed to generate (and to compile) the x86 assembler version. Versions 2.15.03 -- 2.15.05 contain a bug which prevents them from working with the static recompiler. Use an earlier (or later) version.

The generated assembler version consists of *.asm* and *.inc* files (or *.llasm* and *.llinc* files). Move these files into the appropriate subdirectory in the *games* subproject.
